###Creating a simple launch file
In this package, we have a p2os robot that can be spwaned by launching `p2os_urdf/pioneer3at.gazebo.launch` using this command:
```
roslaunch p2os_urdf pioneer3at.gazebo.launch
```

####Note
You are supposed to `make` and `source` the project with `catkin_make` and `source devel/setup.sh` commands.
